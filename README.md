Welcome to Finder, Mount Hebron High School's digital solution designed to quickly and efficiently reunite Vikings with their lost belongings. This application serves as a central hub where staff and students can report items they've found, like a misplaced textbook, a phone left in the gym, or a jacket forgotten in the cafeteria, along with crucial details like the exact location and a photo. Finder’s backend, built on a PostgreSQL database, manages all data integrity by tracking every item and providing a secure system for owners to submit formal claims. This structured approach, which includes tracking items through statuses like 'Pending Review' and linking claims directly to their corresponding item, transforms the often chaotic process of finding lost property into a reliable workflow.
