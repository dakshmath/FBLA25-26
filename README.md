Welcome to Finder, Mount Hebron High School's digital solution designed to quickly and efficiently reunite Vikings with their lost belongings. This application serves as a central hub where staff and students can report items they've found, like a misplaced textbook, a phone left in the gym, or a jacket forgotten in the cafeteria, along with crucial details like the exact location and a photo. Finder’s backend, built on a PostgreSQL database, manages all data integrity by tracking every item and providing a secure system for owners to submit formal claims. This structured approach, which includes tracking items through statuses like 'Pending Review' and linking claims directly to their corresponding item, transforms the often chaotic process of finding lost property into a reliable workflow.

The application's frontend interface is built for simplicity and mobile responsiveness, ensuring that whether a user is accessing Finder on a classroom desktop or their own smartphone, the experience is quick and intuitive. The primary Item Feed presents all currently reported items in an easily searchable format, allowing users to rapidly browse pictures and summaries of found property. Students and staff who find an item interact primarily with the dedicated Report Item Page, which utilizes a clean form to capture all necessary database fields, such as location_found and contact_info, ensuring accurate submission of new items records into the system. For owners, the Claim Submission process is equally straightforward, guiding them to provide specific match_details (proof of ownership) to authenticate their claim.

The core logic and data flow of Finder are powered by the Express.js backend, which acts as the secure intermediary between the web interface and the PostgreSQL database. Express handles all server-side routing, API endpoints, and data validation, ensuring that information is processed securely before interaction with the database. Key routes that structure the application include the root Home Page (/), which drives the Item Feed and acts as the public landing page; the Report Item Route (/api/items), which processes form submissions and inserts new records into the items table; and the Claim Route (/api/claims), which securely records a new claim against an item. Additionally, a restricted Admin Dashboard Route (/admin) provides staff with the necessary tools to review, approve, or reject pending claims and update item statuses, completing the full lifecycle of every lost item.
